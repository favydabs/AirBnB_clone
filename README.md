About the Projects
Be pycodestyle compliant!
mandatory
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseMode  

0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place) - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc… - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) - Update attributes of an object - Destroy an object

Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
